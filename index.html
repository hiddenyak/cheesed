						Have been using this for 6 months to carry cards, cash, carkey, and

						I bought this pouch but only ended up using it a few times. Its too
						big when full for most pockets. The version I bought has X-Pac VX21
						material which isn't stiff enough to keep shape when the pouch half
						filled, but when full, the material contorts in an unpleasant way.

						Toiletry bag with accordion pockets and zippered mesh compartments

						I found the layout to be too small to carry an electric razor or
						electric toothbrush, but too big to handle just my essentials. It's
						a high quality bag, but I don't use it.

						Large toiletry bag that has several types of pockets, a dedicated

						This toiletry bag is on the larger side but I like it a lot it. Good
						for a longer trip or just organization. I can fit basically all my
